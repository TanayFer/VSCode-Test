Logic and Algorithm for Linear Search
Objective: To find a specific element (the "key") in an array by checking each element one by one, and to count how many checks were needed.

Logic:
The linear search method is the most straightforward searching technique. The idea is to iterate through the array from the very first element to the last. In each step of the iteration, the current array element is compared with the key we are looking for.

If the current element matches the key, the search is successful, and we can stop, noting the position (index) where it was found.

If we reach the end of the array without finding a match, the search is unsuccessful.

A counter is used to keep track of every comparison made between an array element and the key. This helps in analyzing the search's efficiency for a given input.

Algorithm:
Start

Define an array of elements.

Get the key element to be searched from the user.

Initialize a counter variable, comparisons, to 0.

Initialize a loop counter i to 0.

Repeat the following steps until i is less than the array size:
a. Increment comparisons.
b. Compare the current array element arr[i] with the key.
c. If arr[i] is equal to key:
i. Print "Element found at position i".
ii. Go to Step 8.
d. Increment i.

If the loop finishes without finding the element, print "Element not found".

Print the final value of comparisons.
