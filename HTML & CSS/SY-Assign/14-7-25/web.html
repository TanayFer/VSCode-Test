                <b>Salher Fort</b>, perched in the Selbari range of Nashik, is the highest fort in the Western Ghats and
                the
                site of a legendary 1671 battle where the Marathas triumphed over the Mughals. Its vast expanse and
                panoramic views made it a strategic watchtower.

                <b>Shivneri Fort</b>, located near Junnar in Pune, is revered as the birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji
                Maharaj.
                Surrounded by steep cliffs and fortified gates, it was designed to be impenetrable and served as a
                cradle of Maratha
                leadership.

                <b>Lohgad Fort</b>, nestled near Lonavala, is famed for its "Vinchu Kata" (scorpion tail)-shaped
                ramparts. Used
                to store treasure looted from Surat, it was also key to controlling nearby trade routes. The fort’s lush
                surroundings make it especially popular during the monsoon season.

                <b>Khanderi Fort</b>, in Raigad district off the coast of Mumbai, served as Shivaji’s maritime outpost.
                With
                its lighthouse and cannons, it was pivotal for monitoring naval activity and safeguarding the coastline
                from European
                intrusion.

                <b>Raigad Fort</b> is perhaps the most iconic—Shivaji’s capital and the site of his coronation. Perched
                atop a
                cliff, it houses
                the king’s throne, queens’ quarters, and his memorial. It reflects the architectural and administrative
                genius of the
                Maratha empire

                <b>Rajgad Fort</b>, Shivaji’s first capital before Raigad, is spread across multiple plateaus. It served
                as a
                launchpad for
                numerous battles and boasts intricate designs that balanced beauty with strategic defense

                <b>Pratapgad Fort</b>, deep in the forests of Satara, is the site of the famous duel between Shivaji and
                Afzal
                Khan. The fort’s
                rugged terrain and hidden passages are testaments to guerrilla warfare techniques perfected by the
                Marathas.

                <b>Suvarnadurg Fort</b>, located on a rocky island off the Konkan coast, was a naval base that allowed
                the
                Marathas to fend off
                Portuguese and British fleets. It’s surrounded by turquoise waters, making it a surreal blend of
                military strength and
                natural beauty.

                <b>Panhala Fort</b>, in Kolhapur, is the largest Deccan fort and was used extensively by Shivaji and
                later
                Sambhaji. It
                includes the "Andhar Bavadi" (Hidden Well) and winding escape routes that helped during sieges.

                <b>Vijaydurg Fort</b> stands tall on the Sindhudurg coast and was reputed to have underwater defenses.
                Once a
                formidable naval
                base, its triple-layered walls and strategic positioning made it almost impenetrable.

                <b>Sindhudurg Fort</b>, built by Shivaji himself, is unique for housing a temple dedicated to him—an
                unusual
                honor for a ruler.
                Located on an island, the fort showcases ingenious construction techniques that blend seamlessly into
                the ocean’s
                rhythm.

                    alt="12th">
                <b>Gingee Fort</b>, the lone outlier in Tamil Nadu, is massive and awe-inspiring. Often dubbed the "Troy
                of the
                East," it
                comprises three separate hilltop citadels and served as a critical outpost for the Marathas in South
                India.
